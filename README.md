**DESCRIPTION:**

So, in the home page, we can view the current date-calendar. There are two buttons that can be clicked on to view the previous and the next month.

In the body, we have the content of the calendar that is displayed in cells. The Sundays are marked as red and the Saturdays are marked as green.

In the footer, we have &#39;jump to&#39; option where a drop down list is given with the months and years to select from.

Also there are three buttons that are floating to the right.

If we are on another month that is not the current month, then by clicking &#39;current date&#39; button, the user will be taken to the current month.

If the user wants to add an event for a particular date, they have to click on &#39;add event&#39; button and fill in the details. After filling them, they&#39;ll be taken to month that they have created the event in.

If the user wants to delete the event, then, they have to click on &#39;view events&#39; button and click the trash icon for the event to be deleted.
